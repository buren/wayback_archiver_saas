Hm.. no URL was sent to the Wayback Machine. So somehing seems to have gone wrong :|

You can:

- Double check the supplied URL (<%= @url %>)
<% if @archivation.strategy == 'sitemap' %>
- Verify that the URL points to a valid Sitemap
<% end %>
<% else %>
Archivation of <%= @url %> finished :)

In total <%= @total %> URL(s) were sent to the Wayback Machine.

View the archive at <%= @archive_url %>
<% end %>
